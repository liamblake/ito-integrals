	abstractNote = {The notion of a Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) is
	                by now well established as a way to capture transient
	                coherent transport dynamics in unsteady and aperiodic
	                fluid flows that are known over finite time. We show that
	                the concept of an LCS can be generalized to capture
	                coherence in other quantities of interest that are
	                transported by, but not fully locked to, the fluid. Such
	                quantities include those with dynamic, biological,
	                chemical, or thermodynamic relevance, such as temperature
	                , pollutant concentration, vorticity, kinetic energy,
	                plankton density, and so on. We provide a conceptual
	                framework for identifying the Generalized Lagrangian
	                Coherent Structures ( GLCSs) associated with such
	                evolving quantities. We show how LCSs can be seen as a
	                special case within this framework, and provide an
	                overarching discussion of various methods for identifying
	                LCSs. The utility of this more general viewpoint is
	                highlighted through a variety of examples. We also show
	                that although LCSs approximate GLCSs in certain limiting
	                situations under restrictive assumptions on how the
	                velocity field affects the additional quantities of
	                interest, LCSs are not in general sufficient to describe
	                their coherent transport.},

	abstractNote = {Uncertainties in velocity data are often ignored when
	                computing Lagrangian particle trajectories of fluids.
	                Modelling these as noise in the velocity field leads to a
	                random deviation from each trajectory. This deviation is
	                examined within the context of small (multiplicative)
	                stochasticity applying to a two-dimensional unsteady flow
	                operating over a finite-time. These assumptions are
	                motivated precisely by standard availability expectations
	                of realistic velocity data. Explicit expressions for the
	                deviation’s expected size and anisotropy are obtained
	                using an Itô calculus approach, thereby characterizing
	                the uncertainty in the Lagrangian trajectory’s final
	                location with respect to lengthscale and direction. These
	                provide a practical methodology for ascribing spatially
	                nonuniform uncertainties to predictions of flows, and new
	                tools for extracting fluid regions which remain robust
	                under velocity fluctuations.},
